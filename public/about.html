<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>**About Me**

  Hello! I’m Bhavana, a passionate third-year Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Analytics. My academic journey has been driven by curiosity and a desire to harness the power of technology to solve real-world problems. I’m particularly fascinated by the possibilities AI offers in transforming industries and improving lives.
  
  In addition to my studies, I’ve honed my skills in web development and programming. I am proficient in:
  
  - **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for crafting interactive and responsive web experiences.
  - **SQL** for managing and querying databases efficiently.
  - **Python** at an intermediate level, with a focus on data analysis and AI applications.</p><p>
  
  Beyond academics, I work as a part-time freelance tutor, helping students from various grades (up to 12th) achieve their academic goals. Teaching has not only deepened my understanding of fundamental concepts but has also improved my communication and interpersonal skills.
  
  Being trilingual, I am fluent in **English**, **Hindi**, and **Telugu**, which allows me to connect with a diverse range of people.
  
  When I’m not coding or tutoring, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, solving puzzles, or diving into a good book.
  
  Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I’ve worked on and the skills I bring to the table. Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
